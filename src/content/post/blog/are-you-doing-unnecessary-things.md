Are you doing wild and unnecessary things?

Whether it's lack of knowledge and experience, or other reasons, sometimes we do wild and unnecessary actions to accomplish things.

### Shifting my audience

I just did a wild and unnecessary thing.

_PSA: Don't do this at home, kids._

I live in Southeast Asia, but since January I've aligned my working hours to North American time zone.

Throwback to January, I just shifted my audience from programmers to founders:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today&#39;s January 1st, and I am officially starting my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildinpublic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#buildinpublic</a> journey.<br><br>So 3 months ago, I started my journey on revealing myself on social media.<br><br>I said to myself: &quot;Welp, let me just wing it and figure things out, maybe I will meet people, maybe not, maybe I should not‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/2ds3Yx90GY">pic.twitter.com/2ds3Yx90GY</a></p>&mdash; Raymel is building in public üöÄ (@pseudokid) <a href="https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1741989325963952628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was a fresh start, and the only people I knew in the space reside in European (EU) and North American (NA) time zones.

Time is a key element on interactions, so I need to ensure that I can interact with these people, real time...

### So what is the "wild" thing that I did?

Doing all-nighters for 4 months.

I will start my day at 6-8 in the evening, and end my day at 8-10 in the morning. That is lunch in EU, and morning in NA.

Unnecessary? Absolutely.

Crazy? More so.

### But why?

I did it so I can interact with EU and NA people in this space, in real time.

[Paul](https://x.com/pxue) told me, "Damn. That's dedication."

I can only say: Yea bro, yeap.

With a sigh of relief that I am finally ending it.

Which leads us to...

**Fixing my schedule.**

Why? April is time to go to out, to go to beaches, at least in Southeast AsiaüèñÔ∏è

Peak heat, peak sun. üåû

All before the months of rain starts in June.

But the real reason is this: my self imposed suffering has already paid off, and I'm perfectly happy with it.

### Is it worth it?

Come February, I've established good relationships with a couple of good people and leaders in the space.

I will always remain grateful to them. They gave me valuable feedback early on.

To name a few, there is:

[Igor](https://x.com/that_igor_) who encouraged me to continue doing long-form content,

[Elias](https://x.com/eliasstravik) who trusted me during the early stages of my first product [recaps.fyi](https://recaps.fyi),

and [Janu](https://x.com/JanuBuilds) who talked sense to me all the time.

Of course, there are more of them. You guys know who you are.

Since then, I'm discovering new people every week.

Worth it, I would say.

### Capping off

To cap off, this a photo from last week.
Crazy sun, at 8 in the morning.

Taken during the first few days of adjusting to a 16 hour leap of my sleep schedule.

What is that wild and unnecessary thing that you did?

What did it bring you?

Tell us.

Cheers!
