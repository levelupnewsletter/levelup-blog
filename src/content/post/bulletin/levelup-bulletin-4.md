### Monthly learnings: I killed my momentum this March.

March is a dull month.

#### Stepping back

I took a step back to reflect on my work for the past 3-6 months, and contemplate my plans moving forward.

With little revenue due to me quitting my 9-5 and taking less freelance work, it is clear as day that I need to shift focus to increase my runway. Doing so will enable me to continue doing my side hustles, like [recaps.fyi](recaps.fyi), [this newsletter, levelup.news](levelup.news), and many more..

#### Momentum

This step back came to an expense though: My momentum.

But that's okay, since I've done a lot for the past 6 months.

I started building my Twitter presence seven months ago, in September 2023.

~1800 followers later, I started building in public in January 2024.

Recognizing the momentum because of the good reception I got, I then introduced [recaps.fyi](recaps.fyi) days later.

#### Traffic is great. Conversions? Nah.

Since then, I experimented with different content formats, leveraged twitter as my main distribution channel, and got tremendous traffic to [recaps.fyi](recaps.fyi), peaking this February at ~400 unique visitors.

but,

- There are zero to no usage of the preview tool
- Waitlist numbers did not change (stuck at 15)
- Waitlist people are mostly friends
- People who used the preview tool are friends as well

This is where I realized this is getting longer than I expected and I can't always drive traffic from Twitter alone. I can't always post about recaps.fyi every single day, or every single chance I get. My audience will get fatigued and it's bad for my Twitter account, which is doing pretty well at ~2.5k followers and getting at least half of my audience who sees my post (impressions).

As bad as the waitlist conversions are, there are learnings of course, and here they are:

#### 1. The product is just weak. It needs a stronger value prop, which solves a pain point.

An example is: _Recapping campaigns is cool, but what if I tell you that you can also do marketing materials with recaps.fyi?_

This will be determined as I continue reaching out to people.

#### 2. Address user friction. What I've seen from PostHog analytics is that people usually stop right before CTA. Maybe they are not convinced?

One thing I noticed is the rules are tight. Why? Because the use cases are very specific. Product Hunt launches, Twitter posts, you can only use recaps.fyi after you made the launch or post.

Maybe, these use cases only works if the value prop is strong enough for people to follow the "rules"

Else, it just adds to friction. It's just a very limited use case, and a very complicated process for someone to bother dealing with.

An example of addressing this is: Broadening the possible use cases by removing the tight rules. By inciting a user's creativity, it will spark interest.

A template by default, should be used in a variety of use cases. A Product Hunt launch needs promo materials before, during, and after the launch. So why limit the tool on "after" scenarios?

Of course, these assumptions will also be determined as I continue reaching out to people.

#### 3. Maybe the product is too half-baked that people choose stay away from it until it's polished

The lack of usage of the preview tool shows it. So maybe that's the case. But the waitlist is not moving, so is either a value prop or a landing page issue.

Maybe I shipped too early. Doing so made me neglect a fundamental aspect in shipping software: Quality.

#### 4. Landing page needs improvement.

The landing page has two CTAs: _Try the beta_ on the hero and _Subscribe to the waitlist_ as a floating button. Majority of people clicked on _Try the beta_. _Subscribe to the waitlist_ should never be a floating button. It should have the same hierarchy as _Try the beta_.

Also, majority of feedback I get on the landing page is removing the SOON cards.

#### 5. Broaden my distribution by reaching out communities on LinkedIn and Facebook.

My only goal at this point is to find people who will help me shape the value prop of recaps.fyi

This is the only step I need fuel [1.](#1-the-product-is-just-weak-it-needs-a-stronger-value-prop-which-solves-a-pain-point) and [2.](#2-address-user-friction-what-ive-seen-from-posthog-analytics-is-that-people-usually-stop-right-before-cta-maybe-they-are-not-convinced)

Part of it is polishing what we have now [3.](#3-maybe-the-product-is-too-half-baked-so-people-just-stay-away-from-it) Transition the product from a half-baked beta to a product that is flexible enough to:

1. Customize video outputs
2. Authenticate users
3. Service payments

I am also working on polishing the Product Hunt and Twitter post templates.

Revamping the landing page copy and design as well [4.](#4-landing-page-needs-improvement) and leave [recaps.fyi](recaps.fyi) as is until it's ready for another momentum.

And move on to other projects and endeavors.
