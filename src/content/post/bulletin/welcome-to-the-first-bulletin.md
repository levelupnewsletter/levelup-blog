Hello, readers!

Welcome to the first bulletin of Level Up Newsletter! **[üëè](https://emojipedia.org/clapping-hands)**

If you get this in your inbox, please consider this a my token of gratitude. You are one of the first 30 people who subscribed to this newsletter.

Yes, we are **30-strong now.** Wohoo! **[üôå](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands)**¬† I promise, we will all look back in this bulletin and look in awe of what our newsletter has become. **[ü§û](https://emojipedia.org/crossed-fingers)**

So, let me introduce myself:

My name is Raymel,

- I am dev for 6 years, specialized on Web and Mobile apps
- I am coding since my teenage years, where I started with Windows apps _(.NET, C#)_
- I failed at 2 startup attempts, for 2 consecutive years _(one in transport sector, another in ecom / agriculture)_
- I had little success on two more endeavors for the succeeding 3 years _(YouTube and Crypto)_
- I quit my 9-5 last year to be a full time entrepreneur
- I started building my social media audience back in September 2023
- I started [#buildinpublic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buildinpublic&src=typeahead_click) in January 2024 to ship my first product, [recaps.fyi](http://recaps.fyi)
- This March, I am launching Level Up Newsletter alongside [Level Up, Founders!](https://levelup.news) blog as a journal, a launchpad of my future projects, and a place to feature projects from the community

_More on [https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1741989325963952628](https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1741989325963952628)_

Okay, let‚Äôs begin. As promised, our bulletins will contain:

1. Monthly learnings of my entrepreneurial journey as a dev turned entrepreneur
2. Weekly curated tech news. We will focus mostly on AI, for now.
3. Featured products. More into this as we release more bulletins.

All good? Let‚Äôs go!

## **Learnings on building in public this early March:**

So I just finished a good February,

_See [https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1763104898940567914](https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1763104898940567914)_

March went by too fast. At this point, I already revealed and promoted my two projects: [recaps.fyi](http://recaps.fyi) and Level Up Newsletter, and got +111 followers.

_See [https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1765903212299919513](https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1765903212299919513)_

_NOTE: We will backtrack on Jan-Feb in the future newsletter bulletins._

### **On recaps.fyi**

While good numbers across various facets are great, it does not tell the whole story.

[recaps.fyi](http://recaps.fyi) is still finding its way to the market.

The biggest lesson to learn here is that, while spamming "[recaps.fyi](http://recaps.fyi)" on each of my post is effective on getting traffic, I wonder if there is a better way to do it.

More leverage, less work. That's the goal.

Plus, we have to talk about conversions. Conversions? Truth is, not good. Less than 1% conversion rate, around half are unverified emails, so it‚Äôs even lower.

We still have work to do, and that is to reach out to social media managers, and craft a good value prop for them. I am going to start finding them on LinkedIn and will share the results.

Meanwhile, we will continue on shipping the self-service Twitter recap generator. There is demand from our friends with Twitter accounts, so it's a good sign.

_Soon:_

[recaps.fyi](http://recaps.fyi) self-service Twitter recap is on its way

_See [https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1763341164051399105](https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1763341164051399105)_

On the other hand,

### **Level Up Newsletter, other projects**

On the other hand, we have other stuff brewing, like this newsletter. My grand plan for this newsletter is to use it as funnel for all of my future products and activities.

One of these activities is resource curation, which is one of my means of giving back to the community. More details on this soon.

We also have a few of small and quick products lined up, which has a strong painkiller effect vs recaps.fyi, which is more of a vitamin.

So stay tuned!

Okay, let‚Äôs proceed on the curated news:

## **This week in tech:**

Google Gemini is very hot this early March, see why:

Demand for AI Prompt Engineers rising?

Last, the featured products:

## **Featured products:**

So I asked the community to list their product‚Äôs affiliate / referral programs, where I promised to feature 5 products on our first newsletter bulletin.

_See [https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1762120650821652959](https://twitter.com/pseudokid/status/1762120650821652959)_

Look, we got 10+ responses. Plenty are of quality, so I can‚Äôt help but feature more than 5!
